# Vantage — Roadmap & Scope Tracker

This file is the **source of truth for application scope**. Every PR should
advance one or more checklist items here (or a tracked issue that maps to one).
Keep it honest: check a box only when the exit criteria are met and verified.

**Legend:** `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done & verified

---

## Guardrails (apply to every phase — never descoped)

- [x] Scan-and-report only; **no** exploitation / lateral movement / auto-fix.
      Enforced as an **executable test** (`orchestrator/test_scope_invariants.py`,
      run in CI): the `Phase` enum, adapter method surface, and activity verbs are
      asserted to contain no exploit/lateral/remediate vocabulary.
- [x] Scope gate enforced at every stage (HOD-approved inventory; fail closed).
- [x] Human-gated validation and manual PT remain downstream.
- [x] All XML parsed with `defusedxml`; secrets only from the vault (the
      defusedxml/XXE guard is asserted in `test_scope_invariants.py` too).

---

## Phase 0 — Foundations  `target: 2–3 wks`
**Exit:** a target can be authorized/denied and every action is audited.

- [x] Postgres schema (`db/schema.sql`)
- [x] `scan_phase` enum has no exploitation value; `report` terminal
- [x] SLA due-date trigger (Crit/High 30d · Med/Low 60d)
- [x] Exception duration→approver CHECK (CISO/RMC/Board)
- [x] Append-only hash-chained audit log
- [ ] Scope gate wired to a real inventory source (`_resolve_approved_targets`)
- [ ] Ed25519 token signing via vault (`_sign_token`)
- [ ] Datastore layer (psycopg) behind the activity stubs
- [~] RBAC / SSO (AD/LDAP + OIDC) — **code complete & tested** (`api/auth.py`:
      OIDC Auth-Code+PKCE, JWKS id_token validation, AD-group→role map, LDAP
      `memberOf` fallback, signed session cookie, `require_role`; RBAC matrix wired
      into `api/main.py`; console identity/sign-in; `db/schema.sql` identities/
      roles/group_role_map). `actor` is now server-derived; report download is
      owner-scoped. **Remaining:** point at a live Entra/AD tenant + enable
      `AUTH_REQUIRED` in the enclave (config/deploy, not code).
- [ ] Temporal cluster + worker deployed in the enclave

## Phase 1 — Infra MVP  `target: 3–4 wks`
**Exit:** end-to-end internal black-box scan → triaged register with SLAs, human-validated.

- [x] Workflow skeleton (`InfraScanWorkflow`)
- [x] Nmap adapter (safe NSE categories only) — `parse()` hardened against
      messy XML + unit-tested against a real `nmap -oX` fixture
- [x] Nessus adapter (VA + CIS) with hardened parsing — CVSS→band + CVE/compliance
      extraction unit-tested against a real `.nessus` v2 fixture
- [x] Normalization engine (raw → `CanonicalFinding`): `normalization.py` bridges
      adapter dataclass output → engine dicts (enum→value coercion at the seam)
- [x] Deterministic triage engine (`orchestrator/triage/`): dedup + CVSS→severity
      + SLA + OWASP/SANS/CIS mapping tables (unit-tested)
- [x] **End-to-end pipeline** (`orchestrator/pipeline.py`): real sample artifacts →
      adapters.parse() → normalize → triage → triaged register; covered by
      `test_pipeline_e2e.py` (severity bands, SLA, taxonomy, cross-tool dedup).
      `activities._load_raw_findings_by_tool` now feeds the demo register
      (real source still pending persisted scan output)
- [x] Excel report export (`orchestrator/reporting/`: xlsx/docx/dual-password PDF
      engine, unit-tested; not yet wired to an API endpoint/screen)
- [x] Human-review UI: validate via the write path (status workflow)

## Packaging & deployment
- [x] Dockerized stack: `docker compose up` → web (nginx) + api (uvicorn) + db
      (Postgres 16, schema auto-applied). CI builds + smoke-tests the images.
- [ ] Production hardening: non-root images, pinned digests, secrets via vault,
      reverse proxy / TLS, healthchecks on api + web.

## UI — Vulnerability Console (`frontend/`)  `spans phases 1–4`
**Exit:** each screen is wired to the API and replaces its mock data source.

- [x] Console scaffold: shell, nav, role switcher, design system, tweaks
- [x] All 8 screens laid out on mock data (`data.js`), SLA reconciled to backend
- [x] Read-only API (`orchestrator/api/`, FastAPI) per `docs/api-contract.md`
- [x] Dashboard + Findings wired to `GET /api/findings` (graceful offline fallback)
- [x] All 8 screens read-wired to the API (detail, SLA, exceptions, reports, scan)
      with loading states + offline fallback
- [x] **Write path (human-gated)** — `PATCH /api/findings/{id}/status`,
      `POST /api/scans` (server-side scope gate, fail-closed 403 out-of-scope),
      `POST /api/exceptions` (duration→tier), `GET /api/audit`. Every mutation
      requires a human actor and is audited; writes throw (no faked success).
- [x] Finding detail status workflow → API mutations (human-gated)
- [x] Start-a-scan posts to the scope gate (approved inventory only)
- [x] Audit trail persists to the hash-chained Postgres `audit_log` (DB-backed
      via `DATABASE_URL`, with in-memory fallback; verified in the Docker stack)
- [x] Finding/scan/exception *state* persists to Postgres — **overlay model**
      (`api/store.py` + `console_*` tables): status changes + API-created scans/
      exceptions survive a restart when `DATABASE_URL` is set; seed catalog stays
      the base, in-memory no-op fallback otherwise. Tested both seams (store↔PG in
      CI's schema job; seed↔store overlay in the python job) + a verified
      restart-survival e2e against real Postgres.
- [x] FP confirm/clear workflow + risk-acceptance via approved exception —
      `POST /api/findings/{id}/false-positive` (analyst) and
      `POST /api/exceptions/{id}/decision` (tier-gated: CISO/RMC/Board approver).
      Approval is the **only** path to `risk_accepted`; the generic status PATCH
      still rejects it. Console: FP confirm/clear on the finding, approve/reject on
      the exception register (role-gated). Persisted via the store overlay; tested
      end-to-end (`api/test_fp_exception_workflow.py`, in CI).
- [x] Reports screen triggers real export — `POST /api/reports` (xlsx/docx/
      dual-password PDF) + `GET /api/reports/{id}/{fmt}` download, wired to the
      screen's generate flow (open + owner passwords)
- [x] Auth/RBAC: the `"A. Mehta"` placeholder is gone — the console resolves the
      real user via `GET /api/auth/me`, shows identity + sign-in/out, and advisory
      role-gates controls; the server derives `actor` and enforces roles. Real
      tenant wiring + `AUTH_REQUIRED=true` is the deploy step.

## Phase 2 — Web MVP  `target: 3–4 wks`
**Exit:** web pipeline parity.

- [x] Workflow skeleton (`WebAppScanWorkflow`)
- [x] Burp adapter (crawl in 3 auth contexts + scan) — issue JSON → `CanonicalFinding`
      parser implemented + unit-tested (severity map, auth-context tagging)
- [x] Nikto adapter — `parse()` hardened + unit-tested against a real nikto XML fixture
- [ ] OWASP Web / OWASP API / SANS-25 mapping tables
- [ ] CIS config review (credentialed Nessus compliance)
- [ ] Word + dual-password PDF export

## Phase 3 — AI triage  `target: 3 wks`
**Exit:** measurable FP reduction with explainability; humans still gate.

- [ ] Redaction proxy (host pseudonymization; strip creds/payloads)
- [ ] Self-hosted LLM endpoint integration
- [ ] Batch structured-output: fuzzy dedup + FP scoring + impact/remediation notes
- [ ] Reconcile LLM output against deterministic severity bands
- [ ] Low-confidence → human queue

## Phase 4 — Governance & lifecycle  `target: 3 wks`
**Exit:** full SLA / escalation / exception lifecycle running.

- [x] Escalation staircase automation (Day 0 → 2 → 4 → 8–10 → 15–20) —
      `escalation.py` (deterministic engine: 5-stage ladder, who-it's-with,
      due-for-escalation) + `GET /api/escalations` rollup; SLA tracker renders it.
- [x] Exception routing UI + approvals (CISO / RMC / Board) — tier-gated
      approve/reject (`POST /api/exceptions/{id}/decision`); approval is the only
      path to `risk_accepted`.
- [ ] Retest / diff flow (closure verification vs prior scan)
- [~] Notification service + ITSM integration (Jira / ServiceNow) — `notifications.py`
      (Notifier + log/in-memory/webhook sinks, dedupe ledger, Jira-shaped ITSM
      payload) wired to `POST /api/escalations/run` (admin sweep). **Remaining:**
      point the webhook sink at a real Jira/ServiceNow endpoint (config).
- [ ] Scheduler with cadence + blackout calendars
      (internal 2×/yr · public 2×/yr · CIS 1×/yr) — would drive the sweep on a timer

## Phase 5 — OSS variant & hardening  `target: 2–3 wks`
**Exit:** license-free pipeline at parity; audit-ready.

- [x] ZAP / Nuclei / Trivy adapters at parity — `parse()` for each (ZAP JSON
      riskcode→band; Nuclei JSONL incl. critical + CVE/CVSS; Trivy JSON vulns +
      misconfigs) unit-tested against real-shaped fixtures, and wired into
      `pipeline.run_oss_pipeline()` (same normalize→triage path; e2e parity test).
      The OSS set is a config swap, not a code change.
- [ ] Pen-test of Vantage itself
- [ ] ISO 27001:2022 evidence pack
- [ ] DR / backup; role attestation

## How scope changes are made

1. Propose the change as a **Scope item** issue (template in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`).
2. If accepted, add/adjust a checklist item here in the same PR.
3. Anything that would add exploitation, lateral movement, or auto-remediation
   is **out of scope by definition** and must be rejected.
